- **Document Quality**: Clear, well-scanned PDFs produce better extraction results
- **First Page Only**: For cost efficiency, only the first page of each PDF is processed
- **Data Privacy**: Documents are processed through third-party APIs

## üîí Security & Privacy

- API keys are entered locally and not stored
- Documents are temporarily processed and then deleted
- No data is permanently stored on servers
- Use secure API key management practices

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"API Key Error"**: Ensure your API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
2. **"Processing Failed"**: Check if your PDF is readable and in the correct format
3. **"Extraction Incomplete"**: Some fields may show "N/A" if not found in the document
4. **"Slow Processing"**: Large files or multiple documents may take time

### Tips for Better Results:
- Use high-quality, clear PDF scans
